IDEAS

Add a "smart" multithreaded SVG rasteriser.
    This code would look at the needed SVG-frames for the next frame.
    Then it would look into memory to see if the needed SVG-frame has already been rasterised.
    If it has not been rasterised yet then a thread will be tasked to rasterise it and add it to a Dictionary of some sort.
    After all the needed SVG-frames have been rasterised they can be drawn to the screen in correct order by a main thread.
    This process should speed up rasterising all needed SVG-frames and thus increase performance thanks to multithreading and skipping SVG-frames which have already been rasterised.
